## Conclusion 
Managing users on a Linux system can be a repetitive task, especially when onboarding multiple new employees. Automating this process can save time and reduce the risk of human error. In this guide, we'll create a bash script that reads user information from a text file, makes the users, assigns them to groups, sets up their home directories, and generates passwords. We'll also ensure all actions are logged and passwords securely stored.
